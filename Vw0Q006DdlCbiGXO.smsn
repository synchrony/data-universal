@title "The speed with which the ventriloquist aftereffect builds up has also been examined. In traditional demonstration of the ventriloquism aftereffect, the acquisition takes minutes or even longer (Frissen et al., 2003; Recanzone, 1998). More recent evidence, though, has shown that the acquisition of a spatial ventriloquist aftereffect can be very fast, even after a single exposure to auditory–visual discrepancy, while the retention of the aftereffect is strong (Frissen et al., 2012; Wozny & Shams, 2011b)."
